# Gyaan Deep – Illuminating Ancient Wisdom with Modern AI

*Gyaan Deep* is a Sanskrit knowledge exploration platform that bridges the timeless wisdom of Indian scriptures with modern AI technology. Our system allows users to input Sanskrit shlokas and instantly discover their source, meaning, and context across Puranas, Upanishads, and other sacred texts.

By combining the spiritual depth of ancient shlokas with cutting-edge AI, Gyaan Deep lights the path of learning, much like a deepam illuminating the darkness.

## Core Concept

Our project draws inspiration from *three powerful Sanskrit shlokas*:

### Frontend Inspiration – Shloka 14 (Nirvana Shatakam)
	⁠“चिदानन्दरूपः शिवोऽहम् शिवोऽहम्”  
	⁠“I am pure consciousness and bliss — I am Shiva.”

This shloka symbolizes illumination and wisdom. It guided the *UI/UX design* to be serene, glowing, and minimal, representing the light of knowledge.

### Backend Inspiration – Shloka 2
	⁠“परात्मानमेकं जगद्बीजमाद्यं…”  
	⁠The Supreme being as the source, sustainer, and resolver of the universe.

Our backend architecture mirrors this principle: a *central knowledge engine* that stores, indexes, and retrieves shlokas with precision.

### AI & Integration – Shloka 24
	⁠“चक्षुरध्ययनम्, वचनं श्रवणम्…”  
	⁠Vision, speech, and hearing unified in one intelligent device.

This inspired our *multimodal AI layer, enabling users to search shlokas via **text, voice, or image*, integrating OCR and speech recognition for a seamless experience.

## How It Works

1.⁠ ⁠*User Input:* Type, speak, or upload a Sanskrit shloka.  
2.⁠ ⁠*AI Processing:* The system converts input into embeddings, finds semantically similar verses, and extracts metadata.  
3.⁠ ⁠*Knowledge Output:* Displays the source scripture, chapter, verse, and meaning in a clean, intuitive UI.  
4.⁠ ⁠*Continuous Learning:* Backend continuously updates the knowledge graph with new shlokas and interpretations.

## Design Philosophy

•⁠  ⁠*Illumination:* The UI reflects Shivoham — clarity, light, and minimalism.  
•⁠  ⁠*Origin & Source:* The backend embodies the Jagad Bija principle, acting as the seed of knowledge.  
•⁠  ⁠*Integration & Intelligence:* AI layer unifies human senses, allowing accessible interaction with ancient wisdom.
